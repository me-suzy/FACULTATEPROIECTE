<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>DCOM and COM</I></B></FONT></P>
<P>DCOM is Microsoft&#146;s approach to a networkwide environment for object communication and services. DCOM is a set of program interfaces based on Microsoft concepts in which objects in a client program request services from objects running inside server applications on other computers in the network. The model extends the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM), which provides a set of interfaces allowing applications to communicate on a single computer running a Windows 95 or NT operating system.
</P>
<P>COM is aimed at providing capabilities similar to those defined in CORBA but for applications on a single computer. The COM model is found in higher-level Microsoft technologies such as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). OLE allows application to be built from smaller components. For example, an Excel spreadsheet could be embedded in a Microsoft Word document. COM provides support for handling the low-level communication between the applications; however, it wasn&#146;t intended for extensive network use.</P>
<P>COM does support some network capabilities, but it requires the developer to write RPC error-handling code, so COM is not a seamless solution for object developers. The idea is to think of your application as a small component providing a service, such as spell checking. By using a common interface such as COM, developers could &#147;put together&#148; an application by combining COM-compliant application objects called <I>components.</I> The capabilities COM provides include:</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A binary standard for function calling between components
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A provision for strongly typed groupings of functions into interfaces
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A mechanism for finding object services
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A life-cycle mechanism that implements reference counting so you know when to destroy the object
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A mechanism for naming unique objects
</DL>
<P>For example, a word processor application could load a spell-checker component using COM by simply referring to it by a predefined name.
</P>
<P>DCOM is an improved version of COM for the network. It allows the developer to send messages to components over the network as seamlessly as COM provides services on a single machine. The developer is completely insulated from the network issues. DCOM uses standard protocols such as TCP/IP and comes as part of NT 4.0 and Windows 98. It is also provided as a free upgrade for Windows 95. DCOM should be available on major UNIX platforms soon.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Several companies are working on standards to improve interoperability between CORBA and COM/DCOM. The OMG has developed a mapping between CORBA and COM/DCOM that is supported by several products. In addition, Microsoft is working on interoperability, which means that applications could leverage both types of object services on a network.
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>RMI</I></B></FONT></P>
<P>As enterprise Java developers, both of these models have one specific flaw. They are not Java-centric solutions. What this means is that although you could integrate them with either CORBA or DCOM, you would have to write some code in other languages, using non-Java libraries. This leads to more complex and less maintainable code.
</P>
<P>In the case of CORBA, you would need to create language mappings to an intermediate format called the Interface Definition Language (IDL). IDL is part of a language-neutral strategy provided by CORBA. Every language has a mapping to and from IDL. These IDL interfaces represent a method-calling API that can be used to access your object from other languages, such as C<SMALL>&#43;&#43;.</SMALL> This mapping limits the capabilities of the distributed capabilities you have to that IDL. Although IDL was designed to be as comprehensive as possible, it certainly is not a Java solution, and therefore it requires you to familiarize yourself with another computer language.</P>
<P>In the case of DCOM, you can send messages only to Microsoft platforms. Because one of the benefits of Java is its cross-platform nature, this is a hard limitation. On top of that, you will need to call out to Microsoft DCOM libraries because today there is no transparent solution for Java to DCOM as, although the BEA WebLogic server does provide a wrapper mechanism for accessing COM objects with RMI. This means you will probably need to write at least some code in another language such as C if you want to use DCOM. This code is cumbersome and harder to maintain than pure Java. It also defeats the purpose of a distributed object solution, which is to create a seamless process.</P><P><BR></P>
