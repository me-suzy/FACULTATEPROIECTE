<P>Having programmed Java since its initial release and written hundreds of programs ranging from 20 lines to 50,000 lines, we have created a number of basic guidelines for enterprise Java development. These guidelines by no means constitute a complete list. Every program has its own idiosyncrasies and every programmer his or her own talents, design styles, and coding preferences. However, we do hope that these guidelines provide a good starting point for your own development projects. As you read them, please note that we have not always applied these rules in our examples. Often, generality and flexibility increase complexity, and we have always tried to err toward readability instead of functionality in putting together the examples for this book.

<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Use properties and resource bundles to define all of the strings in your applications.</B> This will help in two main ways. First, resource bundles make it easier to internationalize applications in this global economy. Second, it&#146;s a lot easier to change a misspelled word in a text file than it is in a Java file that has to be recompiled each time it is changed. As an add-on to this guideline, consider using the java.text package to format data, as we have done in several examples in this book. This takes the burden to parse formats off you and simplifies the localization procedures for your application.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Extending the previous guideline, use properties files to define strings that represent connection information, SQL, or configuration information.</B> Using properties files allows you to reconfigure an application without recompiling it. You could even reconfigure an application on a client by changing the properties file without having to change the code on the client machine or redeploy it. One excellent use of this technique is to list in a properties file the Actions in a JFC program or some other object that encapsulates functionality. The application can load these objects by name from the file when launched. Adding functionality in this case is as simple as implementing the one object and altering the properties file. The loading code and remainder of the application can be left unchanged.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Try to use generic SQL or store SQL in properties.</B> Many developers use one database for development and another for deployment, due to the expense of enterprise-level databases. Even if the databases are from the same vendor, you may want to tweak the SQL on deployment. In short, expect the SQL, database, and driver to change to some degree, and plan for it.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Be paranoid.</B> Use try-catch blocks whenever there is a reasonable possibility for an exception. On the flip side of this guideline, use exceptions from library-type code to notify the application that an error occurred. This will usually be clearer than a bunch of if-else statements.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Be very careful writing multithreaded code and realize that you may miss a possible deadlock condition in testing.</B> Use synchronization when necessary, but don&#146;t just use it willy-nilly. Even in the newest interpreters, synchronized methods take more time than non-synchronized ones. Moreover, they can offer a false sense of security. Some data needs better-planned protection than method-level locks provide, so consider all of your shared data carefully. We highly recommend buying a book on Java threads programming if you haven&#146;t already, just to familiarize yourself with the world of multiple-threaded programming.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Don&#146;t trust the client when it comes to security.</B> Check all of the input into an EJB, servlet, JSP, or message receiver. Especially don&#146;t allow the client to trigger a potentially harmful operation, such as allowing it to run a program by submitting data to a servlet.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Rely on standards for security; avoid inventing your own security procedures.</B> If you do invent your own, make sure to open them to peer review for thorough testing. Sun and its partners are constantly improving and testing the standard Java security mechanisms. Rather than try to duplicate their efforts, participate in their peer review process and make Java secure for everyone.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Compartmentalize code for servlets and enterprise beans the same way you would the objects in a program.</B> In other words, use one servlet for one type of functionality, or one bean for one business area. Don&#146;t create a &#147;kitchen sink&#148; servlet, bean, or any Java object. Balance this rule with a desire to hide implementation and try to provide very powerful enterprise beans that have 5 to 15 methods that can hide the complexity of the server implementation from the client. For example, implement the e-commerce for a site in a bean that provides buy, sell, check credit, and other functionality into a few clear methods. But don&#146;t have this same bean search the Web site or anything like that. This type of macro-object design should facilitate reuse in your company&#146;s projects.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Design for extensibility.</B> One way to do this is to use properties files to define code to load. Others include encapsulating functionality into objects such as beans and servlets. Users, managers, and the marketing department will always want new, better, more features. Expecting this at the beginning makes life easier in the middle of a project. However, on very small, targeted projects, don&#146;t waste time building extensible code. If you could rewrite the code three times in the time it takes to design an extensible version, and you plan to write it only once, you probably don&#146;t need the flexible design. You can also use components to promote extensibility.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Protect grouped operations with transactions.</B> This is the tried-and-true mechanism for ensuring that operations perform atomically. Use it.
