<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Choose your server providers carefully.</B> Think about the features they support, their compliance with Java standards, and the additional services they provide. This applies to all of the servers mentioned in this book, including but not limited to database servers, transaction monitors, messaging servers, application servers, JNDI providers such as LDAP, Web servers, and CORBA ORBs. Weigh the functionality against the provider&#146;s experience and track record. For example, just because some providers can write a transaction monitor that supports JTA or JTS, that doesn&#146;t mean that they are good at it or understand the subtleties. A great example of this, from a totally different programming area, is the use of WindRiver Systems&#146; real-time operating system on the Mars rover. An error occurred in the application code on the rover while it was on Mars. But WindRiver, having a great deal of experience with real-time systems, had planned for that type of error and included support for dynamically updating the code. Not only were the programmers able to leverage the tools provided by WindRiver&#146;s experience, but they were also able to use an important, but little used, feature to fix the problem. A less professional system provider may not have had the insight to include the feature or the tools.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Utilize each server to its fullest, both for resources and functionality.</B> Take advantage of database optimizations that increase performance, rely on application server connection pools, and optimize message delivery with your JMS provider. All of the enterprise technologies rely on providers. These providers, once chosen, can play a central role in creating a high-performance enterprise application.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Rely on standards for enterprise interfaces.</B> When possible, use the agreed-upon standard rather than a particular provider&#146;s extensions. In several cases over the past three years, these extensions have been discontinued in favor of a standard API. The last thing you want is to finish a yearlong project just in time to have the server provider change its interface on you.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Choose your virtual machine provider and server operating system with care.</B> Recent performance tests have shown a great improvement in Java performance, but they also show a wide difference between implementations when it comes to performance. In some cases, faster computers actually run Java more slowly because of the VM implementation.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Familiarize yourself with your virtual machine.</B> The Windows VM that comes with the JDK, for example, provides flags for defining the maximum memory size and whether or not to use a just-in-time compiler. Many server applications may require more memory than the default and will need to be run with adjusted parameters. Other VMs may provide special parameters as well. In a 24x7 environment, the VM is as important a part of your application as the enterprise API providers that you choose.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Plan for firewall tunneling in Internet applications.</B> Expect the client to use a proxy server that requires you to access the server via a servlet or HTTP gateway. RMI already supports this, but you will need to make sure that the gateway is installed. JMS providers may or may not provide a gateway for their product, and JNDI may not work across this boundary. Always consider the possibility of a servlet that acts as a gateway to your server program. If possible, make this servlet optional to clients inside the firewall.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Don&#146;t get caught up in the version madness.</B> It takes time to deploy an application, and you should expect to use the same version of an interface for at least a year, unless there is a specific reason for changing. New versions of all of the enterprise technologies will probably be announced in the next 12 months. Don&#146;t race to the new version just because it&#146;s there, and don&#146;t wait for the next version before implementing your project. For the time being, Java APIs are like buying a computer. Sure, a new one will be out soon, but if you always wait to buy the latest and greatest, you&#146;ll never get the project done. Combine this with the previous guideline as well, because sometimes it is better to wait a month or two for the standard rather than take the proprietary version today. Many of the enterprise APIs will have updates designed to help library implementers and service providers. Although these updates indirectly help you, you will often be able to simply update the server without changing your code.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Write 100-percent Pure Java code whenever possible.</B> This code is more portable and easier to maintain. If performance is an issue, research other VMs. Recent tests show Java is comparable to C and C<SMALL>&#43;&#43;</SMALL> in a lot of cases and, when taking into account the savings in memory management code, can reduce resource usage.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Read a lot.</B> One source can&#146;t cover everything. That includes the documentation, the specifications, examples, tutorials, this book, and other books. Enterprise computing is complex; don&#146;t underestimate the value of more information.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Test everything, a lot, and then test it again.</B>

<P>Hopefully, these guidelines will help you with your enterprise development. If you have other suggestions, please forward them to the authors for inclusion in future publications.

<P>In the past two years, Java has grown from an interesting way to make cool Web pages to a powerful language for developing enterprise applications. As Java moves from the client to the server, there will certainly be hiccups, problems, and evolving standards. There will also be new, innovative applications that leverage Java and the portable environment it provides&#151;applications such as developer tools that can be used to create both the client and server, databases that can be replicated across the enterprise and even into a personal digital assistant, televisions that run the same code a computer does, and houses that notify an EJB when their internal temperature changes.
</P>
<P>The enterprise Java technologies such as servlets, Enterprise JavaBeans, and the Java Messaging Service are the first steps in bringing Java to the corporate network for application developers and network administrators. Combined with Java on the client, personal Java, and embedded Java, these technologies are designed to form the foundation for future enterprise development.</P><P><BR></P>
