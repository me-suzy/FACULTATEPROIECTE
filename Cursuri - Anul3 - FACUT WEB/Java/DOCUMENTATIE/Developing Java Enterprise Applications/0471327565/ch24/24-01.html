</FONT></H2>
<P>The first 23 chapters of this book introduced, compared, and provided examples for a number of the Java enterprise technologies. This chapter summarizes these technologies and discusses their intended use. A set of general guidelines and other things to consider are also discussed. Chapters 25, &#147;A Four-Tier Online Store,&#148; and 26, &#147;MiniJMS: A Java Messaging Service Provider,&#148; demonstrate all of the technologies discussed in this book in the context of two large applications.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading2"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">The Technologies</FONT></H3>
<P>The enterprise technologies can be broken into three categories: programming models, supporting libraries, and networking models. JNDI and JDBC are really libraries, or frameworks, for accessing information. Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and Enterprise JavaBeans all define an application type. These join applets and applications in the continuum of Java program models. RMI and JMS are both models for network computing. Both can be used with the available program types to create distributed applications. For example, a servlet could use RMI to contact an Enterprise JavaBean that uses JMS to contact a Java application. As your applications grow to support the entire enterprise, you will likely find more and more complex combinations of these technologies. Hopefully, the following summaries and guidelines will help you decide when and where to use each technology.
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>JDBC.</B>
<DD>The Java Database Connectivity libraries are used to connect a Java program to a data source. The initial version of JDBC was targeted at relational databases, but JDBC 2.0 extends this model to other types of data sources. Of all of the technologies discussed, it is perhaps easiest to determine whether JDBC should be used. To access a database, you will probably want to use JDBC. Be very careful to consider the long-term implications of the other options available, such as portability across multiple data sources.
<DT><B>JNDI.</B>
<DD>The Java Naming and Directory interface, like JDBC, is really an enabling technology more than a library for use all by itself. Many of the technologies discussed in this book rely on JNDI to provide access to objects such as enterprise beans and JMS destinations. With the advent of corporate directory services, JNDI will also find a place as a core connectivity library between Java programs and these directories.
<DT><B>Servlets.</B>
<DD>Servlets extend Web servers. In an enterprise environment, servlets can be used to solve a number of problems. First, servlets replace CGI in providing server-side processing for HTTP requests. Second, servlets can extend dynamic Web pages using server-side includes or JavaServer Pages. Third, servlets can be used to form a gateway between Web clients and other services, such as databases, Enterprise JavaBeans, and JMS. Finally, servlet interfaces can be used as a generic interface for services. For example, programmers might use the service method as an interface for generic RMI objects or even enterprise beans.
<BR>Making the decision to use a servlet over another Java technology is usually based on the deployment environment more than anything else. If you want to support clients using Web browsers to access your program&#146;s functionality, a servlet will likely be involved somewhere. On the other hand, if the clients are Java applications on an intranet, it is likely that they would contact the server directly. Between these two cases are the Java clients that are separated from the server by a firewall. In this case, servlets can preprocess requests for the server, or RMI can be tunneled through the firewall. RMI tunneling requires some configuration on the server but simplifies the client/server relationship, while servlets act as a filter point that supports both browser-based and custom clients.
<DT><B>JavaServer Pages.</B>
<DD>JavaServer Pages are used to create dynamic Web pages using Java as a scripting language. JSPs are primarily used in situations in which a Web page changes with each request. Ultimately, JSPs compile to servlets, so the real decision for using a JavaServer Page is whether to use it instead of a servlet, or some other server-side scripting solution. In this first comparison&#151;JSP versus servlet&#151;the decision to use a JSP should be based on two criteria. First, are there a lot of similar pages being returned, and if so, can they share the JSP? If not, a servlet may use fewer server resources. Second, does the displayed Web page require editing by a page designer? If so, JSPs are much easier for the designer and programmer to collaborate on than HTML compiled into a straight servlet.
<BR>The second comparison between JSP and other technologies such as Active Server Pages and server-side JavaScript is also decided by several criteria. Certainly, you can use JSPs only if your Web server supports them. Otherwise, the server may support one of the other technologies. Second, the people scripting the pages need to know enough Java to do their job. This can actually be an advantage, because the programmers writing Java applications and applets can support the Java in a JSP, although they may not know Visual Basic or JavaScript to support those technologies. Finally, each of these technologies provides slightly different features; one or two of these features may make the decision for you. In this last case, the important thing to remember is that Java and JSPs are probably the most flexible choices of the server-side page scripting technologies and will often provide better long-term support for the features you require.
