<P>The container defined by the EJB specification performs another key benefit. It defines the services that EJB programmers can expect to have available to them. This includes database access, transaction management, the bean&#146;s life cycle, and JNDI. By demanding these services be available through the standard interfaces, EJB promotes the concept of reusable, write-once, run-anywhere server components. Ideally, an EJB can be deployed on any server that supports the specification, without being recompiled.
</P>
<P>Although EJBs are defined as Java objects, the specification does not intend them to be limited to Java applications. In other words, a C<SMALL>&#43;&#43;</SMALL> or Visual Basic programmer might access Enterprise JavaBeans on the server to perform work for those other programs. This interaction might happen through a custom protocol supported by the bean&#146;s container or through CORBA, as discussed later in this chapter. Regardless of the mechanism, EJBs are intended to provide a standard component architecture for server objects, not a Java-only technology for pure Java applications. This distinction is especially important in applications that access legacy data.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading2"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Roles</FONT></H3>
<P>The EJB specification defines a number of roles in the EJB application development and deployment process. In many cases, one person or company will perform multiple roles, but here they are separated to clarify who does what and where the lines are drawn when using this technology.
</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading3"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Developers</FONT></H4>
<P>The first role in creating EJB applications is the EJB programmer. This is the person who creates the Enterprise JavaBeans. He or she will be a Java developer who understands the specification and creates Jar files containing Enterprise JavaBean code. Part of this person&#146;s job is to define two key Java interfaces for an EJB. The first interface, called the Home interface, defines how programs can create EJBs on the server. For example, are their arguments used to create an object, or do you possibly find existing objects without creating them directly?
</P>
<P>The second interface that an EJB developer defines is the bean&#146;s direct interface. This interface extends the java.rmi.Remote interface, making it represent a set of distributed object messages. Although the interface is defined using RMI, it may ultimately be accessed with CORBA or another technology. The EJB specification doesn&#146;t say how the interface is accessed, only that it is defined this way. The main purpose of the bean&#146;s remote interface is to succinctly state the messages that a client can send to a bean.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading4"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Assemblers</FONT></H4>
<P>Programmers who use Enterprise JavaBeans are called <I>assemblers.</I> In the simplest case, these programmers use JNDI to access the home interface for a bean, then use this interface to gain access to the beans themselves before sending messages to them. As the EJB specification gains industry support, tools vendors are beginning to support visual tools for assembly or including Enterprise JavaBeans in an application. The compiled results of the assembler&#146;s work can range from other EJBs to JavaBeans to applets to applications. Basically, any form of Java project might take advantage of EJBs for server programming.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading5"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Deployers</FONT></H4>
<P>Enterprise JavaBeans are hosted on a server within a specific container. This container has a number of settings that configure the bean and its surrounding environment. A <I>deployer</I> is the person who defines what the bean&#146;s environment looks like and actualizes this environment by deploying the bean to a specific server host. One example of a deployer&#146;s job is to define any resource pools used by a bean or transaction scopes associated with a bean&#146;s methods.</P>
<P>Chapter 17, &#147;Deploying Enterprise JavaBeans,&#148; provides a short discussion of deploying beans but should not be considered a complete text. Each server provides different tools for deploying Enterprise JavaBeans, and you should refer to the documentation for your server to determine what steps the deployer takes and what options he or she has available to them.</P>
<P>Beans are deployed to a server and bound to a JNDI context for access by the client. By using the standard JNDI to access enterprise beans, the EJB specification minimizes the learning curve and maximizes the naming options for enterprise bean systems.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading6"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Server Providers</FONT></H4>
<P>The company or organization that provides a server for hosting enterprise beans is expected to implement as much of the EJB specification as it requires. However, the provider may also implement other features that differentiate it from its competition. This specification is considered a minimum. Providers can create other libraries that augment their products or tools that make them easier to use.
</P>
<P>One of the great things about Enterprise JavaBeans is that many types of servers can support them. For example, an application server can host EJBs as part of the server portion of a distributed application. An application server is expected to provide a fast, secure, robust environment for the beans, but it doesn&#146;t need to provide a lot of bells and whistles. Rather, it is a middle tier in a larger application, intended to provide processor power and networking connections. The application server provider&#146;s main job is to make writing that middle tier as easy as possible, and that&#146;s where Enterprise JavaBeans fit in.</P>
<P>Several database vendors have also announced support for Enterprise JavaBeans. In this case, the beans will likely have very direct access to the data in a database. Rather than use the database as a processing hub for standard requests, the EJB developer will use an EJB-enabled database to implement smart data management. The bean can search data locally before responding to requests from the client. In a high-performance situation like the one pictured in Figure 15.4, an application might do preprocessing on an application server, send specific requests to a database EJB for data optimization, and return the results to the user after post-processing them on the application server again. Essentially, enterprise beans become super-smart, object-oriented stored procedures on the database.</P>
<P>Operating systems vendors may even use the EJB specification as a way to host services for users on that machine.</P><P><BR></P>
