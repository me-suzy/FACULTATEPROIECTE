<H3><A NAME="Heading32"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Security and Enterprise JavaBeans</FONT></H3>
<P>The security for enterprise beans is managed primarily by the container. The bean gets access to its security information through the context. The extent of this information is the identity or role of the caller. In this respect, EJB security is not a complex issue.
</P>
<P>However, there is a lot going on &#147;under the covers.&#148; First, the bean has a number of security options set during deployment. These include the ability to define roles and individuals associated with the bean. Second, the bean can use one of three security modes: run as the client, run as a system object, or run as a specified identity. This specified identity depends on the client and the type of bean. Stateful session beans are assigned an identity at creation and maintain it throughout the session. All other beans must keep the same identity within a transaction. Beans may also be able to specify if they want to control identity at a method level or at the level of the entire bean. In other words, a bean might allow managers to execute the update method and allow employees to execute everything else.</P>
<P>Although the bean developer/deployer can set up the security parameters, it is the EJB host that tracks the current identity for a bean.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading33"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Summary</FONT></H3>
<P>Enterprise JavaBeans represent a powerful new standard for enterprise computing. Enterprise beans fall into four categories and should be used appropriately:
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stateless session beans</I> are used to implement stateless operations. For example, a stateless bean might be used to perform a query, implement a business rule, or perform a numerical calculation.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stateful session beans</I> store information throughout a session. These beans should be used when the client wants to interact with a single bean throughout the session. For example, an ATM bean might track the current users&#146; accounts while they perform various operations such as balance inquiries and deposits.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Entity beans with container-managed persistence</I> represent application objects that rely on the server to store them. These beans should be used whenever possible, keeping in mind the limitations placed on the bean by the container&#146;s management configuration techniques and features.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Entity beans with bean-managed persistence</I> represent a flexible mechanism for representing persistent application objects. Bean-managed entities should be used when the container cannot provide the search capabilities, cannot be optimized appropriately, or doesn&#146;t support the desired persistent store.
</DL>
<P>All bean developers should follow a number of programming guidelines, according to the specification:
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beans should not create threads or terminate running threads, because doing so may interrupt the EJB host.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beans should not use mutable, static variables. All static variables for EJBs should be marked as final for safety. Beans may be accessed in a separate VM for each client, so these static variables don&#146;t really get shared anyway. Note that some of the examples in this text break this rule for simplicity, and this is definitely an example of do as we say, not as we do&#151;heed our warnings! The larger examples at the end of the book form a more &#147;correct&#148; representation of these rules because they represent more real-world applications of the Java enterprise technologies.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beans should not use thread synchronization primitives, because they may interfere with the host&#146;s thread management.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless a bean specifically indicates that it will manage transactions, the bean should not perform any transaction management.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beans are assigned a security Identity and should not attempt to change it.
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beans that rely on the container for transaction management should not manage JDBC transactions; the container will perform this operation for them.
</DL>
<P>All enterprise beans must be hosted. This host will be expected to provide services, but your decision of which host to buy may also be driven by the legacy application that you want to access. For example, if you want to use entity beans to represent COBOL data, you may have to choose a different host than if you want to use entity beans in a relational database. Once you make the host decision, you should be able to create portable, robust beans that will run on that server or another one if you choose to update it.
