<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Active Server Pages</I></B></FONT></P>
<P>Active Server Pages (ASP) is part of Microsoft&#146;s Active Platform strategy. It is an additional component added to the Microsoft Web server that can process scripts inside files with the extension .asp. These files can contain various supported scripting languages, but primarily they use a scripting extension to HTML called VBScript. VBScript is based on Visual Basic and has the capability to call out to ActiveX components. This strategy is a Microsoft-centric solution that is implemented in its Internet Information Server (IIS).
</P>
<P>Like most server-side scripting solutions, ASP is not intended to replace client-side scripting. Instead, it is designed to provide &#147;glue&#148; between the HTML and client side scripting (like JavaScript) and the business logic that resides on the server.</P>
<P>An ASP application is typically composed of:</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scripting code
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;ActiveX components
</DL>
<P>The following code represents the contents of a file called Hello.asp. The output from executing this Active Server Page is shown in Figure 9.3. The code defines a function called WriteDate, which is executed in the body of the HTML document between special ASP tags &lt% and %&gt.
</P>
<P>The interesting part of the script is in the body of the actual HTML. The &lt% tag is used to designate a script. When the client requests the Web page Hello.asp, the server treats the HTML in the file as a template. The server interprets the script and inserts the results of executing the VBScript code into this HTML. Finally, the resulting data is then sent to the client.</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<PRE>
&lt%@ LANGUAGE=&#147;VBSCRIPT&#148; %&gt
&ltSCRIPT RUNAT=SERVER LANGUAGE=VBSCRIPT&gt
Sub WriteDate()
    Response.Write(&#147;&ltB&gtThe current date is &#148; &amp Date &amp &#147;&lt/B&gt&ltBR&gt&#148;);
End Sub
&lt/SCRIPT&gt

The next line is an ASP script embedded in the HTML: &ltBR&gt&ltBR&gt
<B>&lt%
    Call WriteDate()
    Response.Write(&#147;That was the date.&#148;);
%&gt</B>

&lt/BODY&gt
&lt/HTML&gt
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->
<P>Because the file name of the code above ends in .asp and assuming the code is placed in the correct directory for your server, the server automatically interprets it as a server-side application. This means that all code designated by the scripting tags will be replaced with the results of executing the code. The &lt%@ tag designates that this is a script written using VBScript. The &ltSCRIPT&gt tag designates that this script is expected to be executed on the server. Further extension to Web clients may allow for client-side processing as well. Everything between the &ltSCRIPT&gt&lt/SCRIPT &gt tags is definition for a simple VBScript subroutine.
</P>
<P>Here is what the client would see if it were to view the source of the Web page on the client:</P>

That was the date.</B>

<P>The major advantage of ASP is that it is well integrated with other Microsoft technologies. It also supports an API for adding other scripting languages such as JScript or PERL. However, ASP works only with Microsoft server solutions and does not directly work with standard Java libraries. This means it has limited value to enterprise Java developers.
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Server-Side JavaScript</I></B></FONT></P>
<P>JavaScript, originally called LiveScript, was developed to make client-side HTML scripting possible. Scripting enables a Web page to do some processing such as field validation on the client, saving the extra trip on the network. As Figure 9.4 shows, early scripters started creating HTML forms and using JavaScript to handle form validation, such as making sure people type their Social Security numbers correctly.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>JavaScript actually shares little with Java in terms of its object model or the programming paradigm it uses. However, the syntax is close enough that it is easy for Java programmers to learn and use. Over time, the language evolved. Microsoft released JScript, which is essentially Microsoft&#146;s implementation of JavaScript. The industry feared that the language would be splintered, so the European standards group European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) developed ECMAScript, which has become the standard that all derivations of JavaScript support. For more information, see <A HREF="www.ecma.ch/news/e262-ii.htm.">www.ecma.ch/news/E262-II.htm.</A>

<P>It wasn&#146;t long before these scripters wanted to handle what happened to their forms once they were submitted to the server. To help make this possible, Server-Side JavaScript, originally called LiveWire, was developed. LiveWire was one of the first server-side scripting solutions. It enabled JavaScript programmers to process forms, access databases, and create dynamic HTML on the Web server in much the same way ASP does. JavaScript also has the ability to make calls to programming libraries that use the Netscape API. In general, Server-Side JavaScript plays the same role as VBScript does in ASP.
</P>
<P>Here is what the HelloWorld program, written for ASP, would look like when written using Server-Side JavaScript:</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<PRE>
&ltHTML&gt
&ltHEAD&gt
&ltTITLE&gtServer-side JavaScript Example&lt/TITLE&gt
&lt/HEAD&gt
&ltBODY&gt
<B>&ltSERVER&gt
function</B> writeDate()
{
    var theDate = new Date();
    var theDateString = theDate.toLocaleString();
    <B>write</B> (&#147;&ltB&gtThe current date is &#148; &amp theDateString &amp &#147;&lt/B&gt&ltBR&gt&#148;);
}
<B>&lt/SERVER&gt</B>

The next line is in Server-Side JavaScript embedded in the HTML: &ltBR&gt&ltBR&gt
<B>&ltSERVER&gt
    writeDate()
    write(&#147;That was the date.&#148;);
&lt/SERVER&gt</B>

&lt/BODY&gt
&lt/HTML&gt
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->
<P>As with ASP, Server-Side JavaScript is embedded in an HTML document. This document is compiled into byte codes, which are interpreted by the Server-Side JavaScript component of a Netscape server. The tags used to delimit a server script are different, and the syntax is that of JavaScript instead of VBScript or some other ASP-supported language. Other than that, ASP and Server-Side JavaScript are comparable in form.
</P>
<P>Because the choices for server-side scripting provided by the major Web server vendors are similar, your choice comes down to your preferences based on the languages supported, specific features and performance issues in your particular environment, and your overall product preference. Each of the scripting solutions described so far was designed with specific goals in mind, and each solution requires that you commit to either the Microsoft server platform or Netscape&#146;s. The JavaScript language on which Server-Side JavaScript is based was designed specifically for the Web and has little overhead for non-Web-related issues such as UI. VBScript, which is primarily used with ASP and is a modified and stripped-down version of VisualBasic, a more sophisticated and heavyweight language. People debate which of these server-side languages and platforms are better for Web scripting. If you are a Java developer, we suggest you also consider a third option, JavaServer Pages. JavaServer Pages give you more flexibility than ASP or Server-Side JavaScript, and JSP leverages Java as its primary language, which means there is less to learn and better integration with other Java components than either of the other two scripting solutions mentioned here.</P><P><BR></P>
