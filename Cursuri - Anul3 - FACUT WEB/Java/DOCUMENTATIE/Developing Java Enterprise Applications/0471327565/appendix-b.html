<H2><A NAME="Heading1"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">APPENDIX B<BR>What&#146;s on the CD-ROM?
</FONT></H2>
<P>The CD-ROM included with this book contains all of the source code demonstrated in this book, as well as several other example programs and resources. To make the CD-ROM easier to use, it is indexed via an HTML file. This file appears in the root directory, and is named index.htm. Simply open this file in a browser, and follow the links to find examples, resources, and last minute news or information.
</P>
<P>The example programs are available directly from the CD-ROM in the directory ejava_examples and in the zip file ejava_ex.zip. We have provided the zip file for developers on operating systems that will not copy the long file names correctly from the CD-ROM. Inside the ejava_examples directory are a set of sub-directories named for the chapters in the book. These chapter directories contain directories for each example in that chapter. For example:</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
ejava_examples/chapter_13/class_loading
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>contains the example on using the codebase to control class loading in RMI. Inside the ejava_examples directory there is also an index.html file that contains a list of links to the HTML descriptions for each chapter&#146;s examples.
</P>
<P>Keep in mind that some of the examples discussed in the book are not included line for line to save space. In these cases, the complete code is provided on the CD-ROM.</P>
<P>The CD-ROM also contains a number of applications, RFCs and libraries, that can be used to run the provided examples, including :</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;BEA WebLogic Application Server (formerly called Tengah)
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;JBMS 1.5 Evaluation version from Cloudscape, Inc., a pure Java database engine with an included JDBC driver
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Java 2 and the Servlet Development Kit version 2.0
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliza code
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;RFC 1766
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;RFC 2254
</DL>
<P>Please refer to the CD-ROM for the exact details on using these applications.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading2"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">What Is Freeware / Shareware?</FONT></H3>
<P>Freeware is software that is distributed by disk, through BBS systems and the Internet free. There is no charge for using it, and can be distributed freely as long as the use it is put to follows the license agreement included with it.
</P>
<P>Shareware (also known as user supported software) is a revolutionary means of distributing software created by individuals or companies too small to make inroads into the more conventional retail distribution networks. The authors of Shareware retain all rights to the software under the copyright laws while still allowing free distribution. This gives the user the chance to freely obtain and try out software to see if it fits his needs. Shareware should not be confused with Public Domain software even though they are often obtained from the same sources.</P>
<P>If you continue to use Shareware after trying it out, you are expected to register your use with the author and pay a registration fee. What you get in return depends on the author, but may include a printed manual, free updates, telephone support, etc.</P>
<P>The CD-ROM contains two demonstration applications, the BEA Weblogic Application Server and JBMS, that are available for your testing for a limited time. Like Shareware you must pay for these applications if you intend to use them beyond the demonstration time period.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading3"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Hardware Requirements</FONT></H3>
<P>Of course the primary requirement for using the CD-ROM is a CD-ROM drive. To use the JDK and JFC you will also need to meet their installation requirements which include:
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;50 MB of available disk space (if you include the source code, documentation and JavaSoft examples)
<DD><B>&#149;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;16 MB of RAM although more is always better.
</DL>
<P>The examples from the book are under 10 MB including source, compiled files and other resources. You can run these from the CD-ROM or copy them to your hard disk so that you can change them to try out the various techniques.
</P>
<P>Other resources on the CD-ROM include specific information regarding their requirements.</P>
<P>Since enterprise applications require a number of applications to be running, the actual requirements for a developer to use these examples will vary. However, the authors developed all of the examples on Pentium based computers with 32&#150;80 MB of RAM. You will also need a network connection to access supporting applications, documents and libraries that are available from the Internet.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading4"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Installing the Software</FONT></H3>
<P>You can either use the examples from this book directly from the CD-ROM or copy the examples to your hard disk. To copy the examples:
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Place the CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy the ejava_examples directory from the CD-ROM to your hard disk or open the ejava_ex.zip file and extract it to your hard disk.
</DL>
<P>Use the zip file to unpack the examples if you are on a computer that does not recognize the long file names on the CD-ROM. To test whether or not your system supports these file names, open several of the ejava_examples sub-directories and inspect the file names. All source code files should end in &#147;.java&#148; and compiled files should end in &#147;.class&#148;.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading5"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Using the Software</FONT></H3>
<P>Refer to the appropriate chapter for information on running the examples in this book. Remember that many of the examples require supporting applications or hosts. For example, servlets require a Web server, and Enterprise JavaBeans require a host. The chapters that discuss each technology also describe the deployment issues for using them. We have also tried to provide directions on the CD-ROM, in the HTML guides to help you determine which applications or hosts you need for each chapter.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading6"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">User Assistance and Information</FONT></H3>
<P>If you find any problems in the examples included on the CD-ROM please contact the authors using the links provided on the index.htm page to access the web site for errata and other issues.
