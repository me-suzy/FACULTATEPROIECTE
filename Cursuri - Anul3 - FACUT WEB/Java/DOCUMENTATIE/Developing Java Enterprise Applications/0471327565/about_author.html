<P><B>Stephen Asbury</B> is the Chief Technology Officer for Paradigm Research, Inc. This is Stephen&#146;s fourth book on Web technology. He has also authored numerous courses on Java, JavaScript, Active Server pages, HTML and just about everything else that Web programmers need to know. In addition, Stephen has designed and built two Web-based training environments and a number of other commercial applications and frameworks. Stephen lives in Sunnyvale, California with his beloved wife Cheryl.</P>
<P><B>Scott Weiner</B> is president of Paradigm Research, Inc. He has been involved in consulting with object-oriented design and programming for over ten years. Before founding Paradigm Research, Scott ran a mentoring program for NeXT Computers where he helped Fortune 1000 companies embrace object-oriented techniques for creating mission-critical applications. Today, Scott is leading Paradigm Research on a mission to create the best training for development teams leveraging leading-edge technologies and corporate end-users using the latest productivity applications. Scott lives in Northern California with his wife Susan, his beautiful one-year-old daughter, Emily, and their two dogs, Casey and Jake.</P>

<P>First, we would both like to thank the PRI gang; Alberto, Brad, Eric, Ethan, Glen, John, Karen, Kerry, Nicole, Shrinand, and Tyler. Sometimes writing takes away from work and we appreciate their dedication in our stead. Special thanks to Ethan for his LDAP expertise and Alberto for listening to Stephen complain about another late night, a fouled up example, or basically anything worth commiserating about.
</P>
<P>And where would authors be without editors? Many thanks to Terri Hudson, Kathryn Malm, and Gerrie Cho for transforming our sometimes confused expositions into logical explanations.</P>
<P>Finally, unending thanks to our wives Cheryl and Susan. You can only apologize for coming to bed at 3 a.m. and working through the weekend so many times before you realize that the person you keep apologizing to knew long before you did what your decision to write a book entailed. I know from my experience that Cheryl is always two or more steps ahead of me, and although I kick myself for not figuring it out sooner, I wouldn&#146;t have it any other way. I bet if you asked Scott about Sue, he would tell you the same thing.</P>
